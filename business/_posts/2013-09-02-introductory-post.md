Hello, and welcome to our blog.

I am opening this space to share views on the worlds of analytics, business intelligence, and data vizualizations. My goal here is to build a knowledge base of the topics around analytics, and comment on trends, solutions, and practices. Guests will be writing here with me, they are experts with whom I am working on several projects.

###Company

Mango Information Systems is a Belgian company helping businesses take better decisions thanks to data analysis. To do this, we combine the power of business intelligence concepts - good ol' data-warehousing - to the beauty of web technologies - social media, data visualizations and big data, beyond the buzzwords.

We are building a software <strong>helping marketers better target their social media campaigns</strong> by segmenting followers populations on twitter and identifying local and niche influencers. It is called <strong>[tribalytics](http://tribalytics.com)</strong>, you should [check it out !](http://tribalytics.com). You can view the other products and services we provide

-----------------------------------------------------

The main <em>raison-d'être</em> of this blog is to show businesses the ways how they can make use of their data, and the value it is possible to get from it.

We also want to fill the gap between practices of corporate business intelligence on one hand, and web/social media analytics on the other hand. Both worlds coexist independently without interacting with each other, and good practices applied on one side do not often reach the other one, even it they would benefit from them.

The blog contains two sections, aimed at two distinct audiences:

* [business]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/business/) tackles actual analytics problems, and details solutions to solve them, from a functional perspective
* [engineering]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/engineering/) explore the coding and technical aspects.

####Two blogs in one

			<td>spread knowledge about best practices in business intelligence and web/social media analytics</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>Audience <small>who it is for</small></td>
			<td>marketers, community managers and analysts</td>
			<td>web developers, designers and business intelligence professionals</td>

We will try our best to remain concise, visual, and interactive. This is to let you get quickly to the point and save some of your time :).
