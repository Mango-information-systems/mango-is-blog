Hello, and welcome to our blog.

-----------------------------------------------------

My name is Mehdi El Fadil, I am combining the power of business intelligence concepts - data-warehousing - and the beauty of web technologies - social media, data visualizations and big data - to provide my clients with insights letting them enhance their strategy. I will be writing here together with guests who will share their expertise.

My company, [Mango Information Systems](http://mango-is.com) helps businesses make better decisions thanks to data analysis.

We are currently busy building a software <strong>helping marketers better target their social media campaigns</strong> by segmenting followers populations on twitter and identifying local and niche influencers. It is called <strong>[tribalytics](http://tribalytics.com)</strong>, you should [check it out](http://tribalytics.com)!

-----------------------------------------------------

The main <em>raison-d'être</em> of this blog is to showcase our activities and let businesses know ways how they can make use of their data, and the value it is possible to get from it.

We also want to fill the gap between practices of corporate business intelligence on one hand, and web/social media analytics on the other hand. Both worlds coexist independently without interacting with each other, and good practices applied on one side do not often reach the other one, even it they would benefit from them.

The blog contains two sections, aimed at two distinct audiences:

* [business]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/business/) tackles actual analytics problems, and details solutions to solve them, from a functional perspective
* [engineering]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/engineering/) explore the coding and technical aspects.

####Two blogs in one

<table class="table table-bordered">

	<tbody>
		<tr>
			<td>Purpose <small>why we write</small></td>
			<td>showcase how to take better decisions using analytics</td>
			<td>spread knowledge about best practices in business intelligence and web/social media analytics</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>Audience <small>who it is for</small></td>
			<td>marketers, community managers and analysts</td>
			<td>web developers, designers and business intelligence professionals</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>Topics <small>what it is about</small></td>
			<td colspan = "2">social media analytics, monitoring, news aggregation, data-warehousing, data integration, data visualization, public data, big data, multidimensional analysis and faceted navigation</td>
		</tr>
	</tbody>

We will try our best to remain concise, visual, and interactive. This is to let you get quickly to the point and save some of your time :).
